Our GitHub pages provide technical information about our products.

Disclaimer: the documentation and the source repositories are work-in-progress,
they are not complete, and may be incorrect. We appreciate feedback, and
recommend to get in touch with questions and remarks.

We do our best to be open and publish open source. Parts of our work is
intended to be suitable for use by others.

However, some of our work is in private repositories. This can be exploratory
work to investigate approaches or to develop proof-of-concepts, tooling that
is extremely tailored to our own setup and needs, or any other reason.
